While working on the OWASP Top 10 scraping task, I encountered a few challenges:
1. Incorrect XPath Selection
    Inititally, my XPath did not correctly target the Vulnerability titles. I was using an overly specific path that
    missed the intended elements. After inspecting the HTML structure more closely, I realized that the titles were inside
    <strong> tags within <a> tags inside <li> elements. I adjusted the XPath accordingly to //section[contains(@class, "page-body")]//ul/li/a[strong],
    which successfully selected the correct items.
2. Empty Titles in Results
    When extracting the text from the <strong> tags, some entries were returning empty strings. I added the try/except blovk to 
    handle cases where the <strong> tag might be missing or malformed, and I filtrered out empty titles from the results list.

These issues taight me the importance of thoroughly inspecting web page structure and testing XPath expressions carefully. I also gained 
more experience in debugging Selenium and handling ends cases in scraped content.
